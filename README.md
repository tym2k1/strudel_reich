# Electric Counterpoint in Strudel

This is a performance-based coding project recreating Steve Reich's
*Electric Counterpoint* using [Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/).
Instead of using pre-recorded guitar tracks, all 12 guitar parts are pre-coded.

## About the Piece

*Electric Counterpoint* is a minimalist composition by Steve Reich, originally
written for electric guitar and tape. This cover aims to reconstruct the piece
in Strudel to explore algorithmic approaches to music.
